										<h1>Net import of power in 2019</h1>
										<blockquote>11.8 TWh of power has been imported to Norway during 2019, which is equal to the power consumption in Oslo in a normal year. The main reason for the high import of power is the lack of snow last winter.</blockquote>
									</header>

									<p>For the first time since 2010 Norway has had a net import of power. The power consumption in Norway is expected to grow in the next few years due to offshore electrification, electrification of the car pool, ferries, busses and so on. This increase in power consumption will be handled by new wind power plants, import and flexibility. The net power import occurred in February, March, April, May, November and December.</p>

									<p>11.8 TWh of power has been imported to Norway during 2019, which is equal to the power consumption in Oslo in a normal year. The main reason for the high import of power is the lack of snow last winter. This led to a smaller production of power in hydro power plants due to reservoirs not being properly filled. Or rather, that the hydro power plants held back production to maintain a secure delivery of power throughout the year. The fact that we have imported as much power to Norway as we have done implies that the prices in many periods has been lower in our neighbouring countries. In other words, the interconnected cables allow a cheaper power bill in Norway.</p>
