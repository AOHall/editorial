										<h1>Power Prices Norway November</h1>

										<h2 id="content">High prices in the Nordics</h2>
										<p>Monday 26<sup>th</sup> of November the power price in southern Norway rose to around 66,2 EUR/MWh, from 51,71 EUR/MWh at the end of the previous week. The main reason for this is drier and colder weather with little wind.<br>The power price in the Nordics are particularly affected by the weather, but also by the price development elsewhere in Europe where key factors are CO2-price and coal-price. The Norwegian and Nordic power prices however are still much lower than elsewhere on the continent.</p>
											
									<hr class="major" />

									<h4>The current situation</h4>
									<p>There were a few hours where the power price was around 103,42 EUR/MWh in the area around Oslo in the start of the week, while the price in for instance Belgium was 350,6 EUR/MWh.<br>Wednesday the power is traded at around 49,64 EUR/MWh in all the different el-spot areas in Norway, in other words a little bit lower than the high levels earlier in the week. The prices dropped again due to the weather heating up.</p>
									<p>In the third quarter Norwegians payed on average 127,62 EUR/MWh for the power and fees connected to the power. According to the Norwegian Statistical Agency (SSB). Which is a raise of 30 % from last year. Of the total price, the price of the power was on average 57,19 EUR/MWh, which is a staggering 66 % higher than the same quarter last year. It is also the highest power price in Norway since 2011. The high prices will most likely be maintained throughout the winter.</p>
									<p>Contracts for power delivery in December, January and February are on average 51,71 EUR/MWh according to the Nasdaq-exchange. This price could very well be even higher than what the future contracts predict. An estimation around 55 EUR/MWh is not unreasonable.</p>  
									<p>The power system in Europe is changing a lot nowadays and for instance wind power is more and more popular. The wind power source is unpredictable thus the power price will most likely be both higher and more unpredictable in the coming years.</p> 
									<p>The last twenty years the power price has been around 26 EUR/MWh. So, the prices now are very high.</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h4>What's next?</h4>
									<p>While consumers in the capital area pay around 53,8 EUR/MWh in power fees, people in MÃ¸re &amp; Romsdal and Sogn &amp; Fjordane must pay 62 and 74,5 EUR/MWh on average. So, it is not only the power price that differs from region to region but also the fees connected to the power.</p>
									<p>Prices around 66,2 EUR/MWh is something that is normally occurring in periods of high consumption in the middle of the winter. This price is close to the price 1. March last year which was the highest price that year, so the past week is something that we normally experience in the middle of the winter or early spring.</p>
									<p>In the middle of the winter prices usually varies from 41-67 EUR/MWh, first and foremost depending on the temperature. The climate in Norway the past year had the driest summer and wettest autumn in a long time. The winter may very well be colder than expected but we do not know.</p> 
									<p>The power price in Norway is affected by various factors, like how much water is stored in the reservoirs, how much snow there is on the mountain, how cold it is, how much wind is blowing, and external factors such as the coal price and CO2-quotas.</p> 
									<p>After a lot of rainfall this fall the water reservoirs are 79% filled up, from 83% the same time last year. The coal price has been following a negative trend as of late just like the oil price. Whilst the CO2 prices are stable on a way higher level than what they were the same time last year.</p>
									<p>A lot of wind power plants are being built, while coal and nuclear power is phased out. Based on this the average power price in the Nordics should maintain a level around 41-51 EUR/MWh the next few years.</p> 
									<p>It is estimated that there will be 50 TWh new production from wind and solar energy in Europe each year for the upcoming years. This means that the prices will stabilize on a higher level, and we will be more dependent on power from gas to balance the power system. For now, the gas price is a little bit higher than the coal price now.</p>
