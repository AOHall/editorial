								<h3>Porter's Five Forces</h3>
													
													<blockquote>Porter's Five Forces is a business analysis model which helps to explain why different industries are able to sustain different levels of profitability. The model is widely used to analyze the industry structure of a company as well as its corporate strategy. Porter identified five undeniable forces that play a part in shaping every market and industry in the world. The forces are frequently used to measure competition intensity, profitability and attractiveness of a market or industry.</blockquote>

													<h4>The Five Different Forces</h4>
													<dl>
														<dt>Competition within the industry</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>The importance of this force is the number of competitors and their ability to threaten a company. The larger the amount of competitors, along with the number of equivalent products and services they offer, the lesser the power of a company. Suppliers and buyers seek out a company's competition if they are not able to receive a suitable deal. When competitive rivalry is low, a company has more power to do what it wants to do to achieve higher sales and profits.</p>
														</dd>
														<dt>Power of Suppliers</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>This force addresses how easily suppliers can drive up the price of goods and services. It is affected by the number of suppliers of key aspects of a good or service, how unique these aspects are, and what it would cost for a company to switch from one supplier to another. The fewer the number of suppliers, and the more a company depends upon a supplier, the more power a supplier holds.</p>
														</dd>
														<dt>Power of Customers</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>This specifically deals with the ability customers have to drive prices down. It is affected by how many buyers or customers a company has, how significant each customer is, and how much it would cost a customer to switch from one company to another. The smaller and more powerful a client base, the more power it holds.</p>
														</dd>
														<dt>Potential of New Entrants Into an Industry</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>A company's power is also affected by the force of new entrants into its market. The less time and money it costs for a competitor to enter a company's market and be an effective competitor, the more a company's position may be significantly weakened. An industry that is hard to enter is an attractive feature for companies that would prefer to operate in a space with fewer competitors.</p>
														</dd>
														<dt>Threat of Substitutes</dt>
														<dd>
															<p>Competitor substitutes that can be used in place of a company's products or services pose a threat. For example, if customers rely on a company to provide a tool or service that can be substituted with another tool or service or by performing the task manually, and if this substitution is fairly easy and of low cost, a company's power can weaken.</p>
