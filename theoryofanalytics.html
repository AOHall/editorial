										<h1>Theory of Analytics</h1>
										<blockquote>Analytics is the science of examining raw data. Both structured data which is highly organized, unstructured data which is the opposite and semistructured data.</blockquote>

									<h4>Aspects of Analytics</h4>
									<p>There are four important aspects of analytics. Discoveries, insights, actions and outcomes.
									<ul>
  <li><b>Discoveries</b>:</br>What is the key opportunity?</br>Engage stakeholders for perspectives and concerns.</br>What is likely to happen? Define a hypotheses for which the best data exists.</br>Collect relevant external and internal datasets and validate the accuracy of the data.</li>
  <li><b>Insights</b>:</br>Explore datasets to understand how they would help in accepting or not accepting the hypothese.</br>Use qualitative and quantitative analysis techniques to validate the hypothese.</br>Convert outputs into userfriendly formats and visualizations that will help stakeholders comprehend the analysis.</li>
  <li><b>Actions</b>:</br>Use actionable data insights to explain past outcomes and predict future outcomes. Link insights to operational and financial metrics to aid decision making.</br>Prioritize the insights to build actionable plans, and provide solutions that helps the business to address future challenges.</li>
  <li><b>Outcomes</b>:</br>Develop a clear pathway of how to deliver insights to the right stakeholders at the right time.</br>Make sure that the plans meet long term business objectives and refines solutions in the future.</li>
</ul></p>
									<p>Descriptive, diagnostic and predictive analytics is important for a business to improve. However, being able to know what questions we should ask ourselves in the future, and which dilemmas we may face is perhaps the most important and challenging part of a business. Predictive analytics is not sufficient if we fail to locate the right questions, obstacles and dilemmas that might occur.  Thus, predictive analytics must be thorough and should be based on descriptive and diagnostic analysis combined with innovative ideas and multiple scenarios.</p>
									
									<h4>Descriptive Analytics</h4>
									<p>Descriptive analytics summarises what happened in a given situation or scenario. It includes non-traditional data sources such as social listening and web crawling, and observed customer behaviour. Techniques may include simple box plots, histogram charts with minimums, maximums and means. Computing statistical measures like mean, standard deviation, mode, etc. Plotting the data in quartiles or deciles across different variables. Descriptive analytics lets us understand the current state of affairs and develop the hypothesis to anticipate where business problems and opportunities may lie. </p>

									<h4>Diagnostic Analytics</h4>
									<p>Diagnostic analytics identifies causes of trends and outcomes. Why did it happen? It includes non-traditional data sources such as social listening and web crawling, and observed customer behaviour. It provides the reasons for what happened in the past. This type of analytics tries to go deeper into a hypotheses based on the descriptive analytics. </p>

									<h4>Predictive Analytics</h4>
									<p>Predicts future outcomes based on the past. What could happen? Predictive analytics uses statistical functions on one or more data sets to predict trends or future events. This type of analytics is forward looking and can help the client answer questions like, what will my competitors do? What will the market look like? How will the future impact my service or product? This type of analytics typically predicts what could happen based on what we have seen of evidences.</p>

									<h4>Prescriptive Analytics</h4>
									<p>Recommends one or more courses of action and shows the likely outcome of each decision. Prescriptive analytics executes the actions or takes the decisions that are right for a particular situation. It does so by looking at what occurred in the past, the present state and all of the future possibilities. It provides answers to the question, what steps need to be taken to achieve the desired outcomes? Prescriptive analytics is powerful in understanding the correct actions needed today to address future possibilities. </p>

									<h4>Adaptive and Autonomous Analytics</h4>
									<p>Adaptive and autonomous analytics is still under development, most systems today are either predictive or prescriptive. Very few of them are completely adaptive, or autonomous. However, there are many companies that builds more adaptive, or autonomous analytic solutions where we are eliminating the human aspect. Autonomous car driving is a great example of an adaptive or autonomous analytic solution. Adaptive and autonomous analytics provides answers to the question how does the system adapt to changes? How can we run analytic solutions on a continuous mode? Constantly learning and correcting its behavior to optimize its performance. There may be situations where the speed of decision making, is such that having a human in the process may be counter-productive.</p>

									<h4>Analytical Tools</h4>
									<p>Descriptive and diagnostic analytics usually rely on analytic tools that can handle manipulation of large sets of data or that help visualize and interact with summarized information. Examples include SQL, Hadoop/Spark, Tableau, QlikView, Microsoft Access, SAS, R, and Python. Predictive and prescriptive analytics have traditionally relied on analytics tools that have significant mathematical modeling capabilities or scenario planning or simulation capabilities. Examples include SAS, R, SPSS, and Python. Furthermore, one can use machine learning and deep learning tools, like Scikit, TensorFlow, Caffe, Theano, etc. Natural language processing tools like Natural Language Tool Kit or OpenNLP.</p>

									<p>To summarize: Descriptive analytics helps you understand the current state of the problem and answer, what happened? Diagnostic analytics helps you understand why it happened. Predictive analytics helps you understand what could happen in the future given a certain set of conditions. Prescriptive analytics helps you understand what the right course of actions are today to address future concerns. Adaptive and autonomous analytics helps you answer the issue of how to continuously adapt to change.</p>
