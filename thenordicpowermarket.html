										<h2 id="content">An introduction to the power market</h2>
										<p>It may not be as simple to understand how the power market functions as opposed to the stock exchange. Let us try to explain it in a simple manner and we will do so by introducing the Nordic power market.<br>Just like any commodity, power can be bought and sold. But unlike most other commodities, power must be consumed at the exact moment of production. By having a power market just like Nord Pool, every costumer will know the exact price of the power.</p>
										<div class="row">
											<div class="col-6 col-12-small">
												<h4>Nord Pool</h4>
												<p>In the Nordics power is traded on the power market Nord Pool. Here, the power producers (which can be big hydropower plants), informs how much power they wish to sell the next day and for what amount. And the buyers which can be municipalities, industry and energy companies informs how much power they need the next day and how much they are willing to pay on behalf of the end-users. Based on this the power prices are set for every hour the next day. These prices are also based on how much power that can be moved from one place to another, either internally in Norway between the five different market areas (el-spot areas), or externally between the cables that leads to neighbouring countries.<br>Everyone that trades power on Nord Pool must have a “balance agreement” with their national agency that develops, owns and runs the central electricity-grid. In Norway that agency is called Statnett (which is the company that develops, owns and run the central electricity-grid in Norway). This means that they must deliver and receive the power that they have bought or sold. Thus, there are marginal possibilities to actually speculate in the physical power market.</p>

												<h4>Nasdaq Nordic Power Market</h4>
												<p>At the same times as power is traded on Nord Pool, there is also trading on something called “Nasdaq’s Nordic Power Market”. The trading here is based on what happens on Nord Pool, but it is not the same market. This financial market does not relate to the physical power but rather to securities (documents with economical value). Here the players in the market can secure a price to avoid the movements and instabilities in the physical power market. Which means that they can buy future long-term contracts, but these do not involve a physical delivery of the power. On this market the same power can be traded several times until the power is finally delivered on Nord Pool.</p>

									<h4>Daily Power Auction</h4>
									<p>The physical power market is a big auction. The biggest share of the power that is traded in Norway happens in a daily auction where an algorithm decides the price for every hour for the next 24 hours based on what buyers and sellers have bid. This price calculation happens every day at 12:00, and 12:42 the prices arrive. This happens in most parts of Europe at the same time and there are many factors that decides the result. This algorithm also considers how much power one can transmit from one area to another as I have explained earlier.</p>
									<p>The prices in Norway are affected by the prices elsewhere in Europe, and even though there are direct cables to neighbouring countries there can be price differences between these countries and Norway. Even internally in Norway there are often price differences due to the capacity not being good enough for the power to flow freely. To improve the capacity massive investments would be needed.</p>
									<p>The following day Nord Pool handles the settlement. The power companies get payed whatever they delivered while the buyer (often electricity supplier) must pay. This settlement happens each day. Another note is that the power is traded in Euros, even in the Norwegian market where the currency is NOK. So, whenever Nord Pool states the price in the Norwegian currency they have already calculated it based on the euro exchange rate.</p>

									<h4>Honesty in the market</h4>
									<p>Honesty is very important in the market. Everyone should be able to know how much water there is in the reservoirs, how much grid capacity is available between regions and countries, and other forecasts.  When something unusual happens that can affect the power price, it is important that this information reaches the market. This is done by something called Urgent Market Message, and these are available for all players in the market. An example could be: If for instance a big factory has a fatal technical issue and must stop their production (thus their power consumption) this must be reported as an UMM to the entire market. In other words the power market is strictly regulated which means that vital information absolutely must be given.</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />
									
									<h4>Intraday &amp; market balance</h4>
													<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>In addition to the daily auction, where the players must decide the day before, Nord Pool also has a continuous market, known as intraday. In the intraday-market one can trade within one hour before the power is delivered. This is especially important for renewable energy production which at times can be hard to predict the day before. Furthermore, the intraday-market could be used in case of miscalculations in relation to production or consumption.<br>Example: A wind power plant has promised to deliver a certain amount of power in an hour based on weather forecast, but they realise that they can’t deliver enough as there was less wind than what was forecasted. In this case they would have to buy power from somebody else to deliver what they had promised.<br>At the end the power ends up in the balance market of Statnett (in norways case). This state-owned grid-company makes sure that the power grid is in balance all the time and that the frequency of the grid is as close to 50 Hz as possible.</p>
													<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" alt="" /></span>Nord Pool does not have a monopoly on power trading, and the market-players can engage in deals directly with each other. However over 90% of the power produced in the Nordics is traded on the power exchange market. This is different than other countries in Europe.<br>A typical exception from the 90% is a new wind power plant. Much of the funding could be collected from long-term deals directly with big power-costumers. This sort of a deal is called a bilateral agreement. In England around half of the trade is done with bilateral agreements. The problem with these is that it can make it more difficult for the consumer/end-user to know what the prize really is.<br>The advantage of having over 90% traded in the power exchange market is that the price is credible and open. It sends powerful indications to the market when it goes up or down – that the industry should lower the production or that the end-user should save the power.</p>

													<h4>Being a part of the big European market</h4>
													<p>Nord Pool is international, and the Norwegian power market is an integrated part of the Nordic and European power market thanks to cables that cross countries.<br>Norway was the first country in the world where an open market was established to buy and sell power. This way of distributing the power resource is healthy. Trading power across borders is effective since it enables the usage of the power that is available at all times.  Being part of a cross border power market is something that gains everyone. In years with little rain, Norway wont be self-sufficient with power. Thus Norway is completely dependant on importing power to cover their consumption. If importing power was not an option Norway would have to make massive investments to always be self-sufficient, and this is the case for other countries as well.</p> 
													<p>So even though Norway has a surplus of power most of the time, that doesn’t mean that they are self-sufficient.<br>In the winter of 2010 the weather was extremely cold and dry, and there was a difficult situation in the Norwegian market with high consumption which challenged the power system and there was a danger of not producing enough power. At the same time a lot of the nuclear power production in sweden was out of order, and the cable between Norway and the Netherlands was out of order thus the power availability in Norway was seriously challenged. By connecting the power markets together, the markets get less vulnerable and the presence and availability of power is more stable.</p>
