										<h1>Solar Power in the Nordics</h1>
										<blockquote>Solar energy is the most important energy source on planet earth. In terms of annual energy per square kilometer, the sun is by far the largest source of energy. More or less all processes depend on solar energy. Solar energy drives the photosynthesis, wind streams, ocean streams, rain-patterns and so on, and of course it is renewable.</blockquote>

									<h4>Solar Power</h4>
									<p>Solar power is around us at all times, and it is the biggest energy source we have. Today there are two main technologies to capture energy from the sun: The old fashioned thermal solar collector and the more advanced solar cell. Thermal solar collector is used mainly to heat water for various applications or to dry food, while solar cells are the most used technology for electricity production. Thermal solar collectors are widely used in countries with a lot of sun in simple constructions, as it is an easy and cheap technology. A good solar cell is more expensive with more advanced technology. An advantage with solar cells is that it does not need direct sunlight or warm weather, like thermal solar collector do. Actually solar cells works better in slightly colder weather. This makes it an interesting option for electricity production in the Nordic countries.</p> 
									
									<h4>Solar Cell</h4>
									<p>Solar cells are electronic devices made up by one or more semiconductors that produce electricity when exposed to sunlight. There exists different types of solar cells, but the most common is multi crystalline silicon solar cell. The efficiency of a solar cell is determined by which material is used and production method. The outdoor temperature also has a big impact. In the Nordic countries the outdoor temperature is cold in large parts of the year, and this makes a positive effect on the energy production by a solar cell. When the temperature goes down the efficiency goes up. This makes the fall and spring attractive seasons to produce energy, as the temperature is quite low and the days are still long enough to provide sufficient amounts of daylight. Crystalline silicon solar cells has a temperature coefficient of -0.4% per K. This means if the temperature increase with 20 °C the efficiency decreases 8 %.</p> 
									<p>As mentioned solar cells does not need direct sunlight or warm climate to function. But still, solar cells needs indirect sunlight, or in other words daylight, to function. This is an issue with winter time in the Nordic countries, especially in the northern parts of Finland, Norway and Sweden as it is dark for 24 hours a day during parts of the winter. Thus, solar power cannot supply power as stable as for example fossil-based or nuclear power would. On the other hand, in summer time the days are long in the Nordic countries with a lot of sunlight. Scientist have also found that the solar radiation in the Nordic countries is not as bad as was first believed, and there is clearly a potential for solar power as an addition to other power sources in Nordic countries. In 2010 Northern Research Institute (NORUT) published a scientific paper predicting a bright future for solar energy in the Nordic countries. Simulations showed that certain sunny Nordic regions could produce about as much energy as Freiburg in the south of Germany.</p>
									<p>There are other issues concerning the use of solar cells in Nordic countries, and one is weather condition. Even though solar cells produce electricity in daylight without direct sunlight, it works better with direct sunlight. Also, snow covering the panel are a problem during winter, and leafs and pollen during fall. A possible solution for the snow issue is to use some electricity to heat the cells, so the snow melts. If not, the snow have to be removed manually which is time and capital consuming. If the panels are not covered in snow, the panels will get more sunlight when it is snow on the ground because of the reflection from the snow. Also the solar panels cannot be placed in a fixed position on the ground. The further north the wider the arc of the sun is. This means the sunlight “moves” across the sky and changes positions. Therefore the panels should have sun-tracking to work efficiently. A sun-tracking solar panel should be a certain size for it to be cost-effective, which means some capital is needed to invest. A sun-tracking rig in north of Norway gets nearly as much sun as a fixed one in the south of Germany.</p>
									
									<p>The installed capacity for solar cells in 2014 in Norway was, according to NVE, around 13 MW. In comparison Sweden had around 80 MW and Denmark around 606 MW, while Germany had 177 GW. As Germany has more or less the same weather conditions and amount of sunlight as the Nordic countries, there is potential for the Nordic countries to follow in the footsteps of Germany. About two thirds of the Swedish contribution is wired to the national power grid, while in Norway only 1.5 % is wired to the grid. This means most of the solar panels in Norway is on cabin-roofs, caravans and other private installations. In Norway there is no urgent need to invest in solar power as the cheap hydropower and the rich reservoirs of oil covers the energy demand, and makes the electricity cheap. Also the electricity in Norway is already clean because of the hydropower so there is no urgent need to replace today’s energy sources. But the prices of solar panels have gone down in recent years, and with the possibilities to install it on roofs for easy and cheap energy, solar power is being increasingly popular also in Norway.</p>
									
									<p>There are different ways to use solar cells. One good thing about solar cells is that they do not need to interrupt the nature in the same way as wind and hydropower does. Solar farms are usually built in remote areas where it affects nature very little, and if installed on rooftops it does not interrupt nature anymore than the building would do before. This makes it an attractive option for small-scale power production for private persons on their own house roofs, or for various industries to add some power or to heat water.</p>

									<h4>Heating</h4>
									<p>Solar energy used for heating purposes can be divided into two solutions. Passive exploitation, which means the solar energy is directly used for heating, for example in greenhouses or through windows. This is a way of exploiting solar energy that most people take for granted, but it is the most used form of solar energy today. In Norway it is estimated that between 10 and 15% of building heating comes from this. A lot of building-companies, for example Snøhetta, are looking at ways of exploiting this kind of energy to its outmost and reduce the heating demand in buildings. The other solutions are active exploitation, where the sunlight will be converted to heat in a thermal solar collector. The heat is used to warm up buildings, water and process water for industrial purpose.</p>
									
									<p>A typical solar heating system consists of a thermal collector, heating storage, distribution system and managing system. The system will absorb the sunlight and convert it to heat in the thermal collector. The heat is then transferred to a thermal conductive medium (fluid or gas), which circulates through the collector, and to the heating storage. The heat from the system is led to the distribution system, which distributes the heat to the desired end use. In Norway the installed capacity for solar heating systems was 31 MW in 2013. In Sweden it was around 318 MW, Denmark 564 MW and 12 GW in Germany.</p>

									<p>To conclude, the potential for growth in the solar energy sector is huge in the Nordic countries. Either it is solar panels, smart houses or greenhouses. The enormous amount of energy thrown at us every day from the sun can be used to multiple purposes and contribute to a shift from fossil-based energy production to more renewable. With the recent decline in price for solar panels, the future looks brighter than ever.</p>
