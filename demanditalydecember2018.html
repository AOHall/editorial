										<h2 id="content">Decrease in demand</h2>
										<p>In the month of December 2018, according to what Terna (the company that manages the italian electricity grid) detected, the demand for electricity was 26.5 TWh, dereased by 1.5% compared to the same month of 2017. The trend of the demand suffered because of calendarial and temperature effects. There was one more working day in 2018 (19 vs 18), but the average temperature of December was on degree celsius higher than that of the year before. The seasonally adjusted data corrected with temperature and calendar, leads to a variation of electricity demand down by 1.1%. </p>

The demand for electricity in 2018, which was made up of 35% renewable energy production (compared to 32% in 2017) respresents the highest value since 2013.
