										<h1>Power prices thus far in 2019</h1>
										<blockquote>From the first to the second quarter of 2019 the power prices decreased with 30-32 %. On average the power price has been lower compared to the same period last year. In the beginning of the year the power prices were at a very high level. But since then, the hydrological balance has improved, the price on CO2-quotas has stabilized and the price of coal and gas has decreased. All of this has contributed to the decrease in Nordic power prices. </blockquote>

									<h3>First and second quarter</h3>
									<p>Norway has been a net importer of power from the neighbouring countries in the first and second quarter of 2019. The snow reservoirs were low in the beginning of the second quarter. The snow started to melt early due to a hot month of April. In May and June there was more rain than usual. In the beginning of the quarter the water level in the reservoirs were 1.4 percent below the median, while at the end of the quarter the water level was 2.3 percent above the median. The hydrological balance improved from -12.2 TWh to -4.7 TWh during the second quarter. The reason for this is that the amount of precipitation was relatively normal in the second quarter, while the hydro production was lower.</p>
									
									<h3>Week 33</h3>
									<p>During the summer the prices in the Nordic power market has been quite steady around 40 EUR/MWh. Currently, in week 33, the prices are around 35 EUR/MWh. Even though the consumption of power was a little bit higher in week 33 than week 32, the power prices in the Nordics fell in week 33 compared to the week before. Factors that could have contributed to this are more wind power production in Sweden and an increased production from Norwegian run-of-river hydroelectricity (ROR) power plants. Furthermore, the Swedish nuclear power plant Forsmark 2 came back into operation following two weeks of maintenance. The decrease in power prices in Norway contributed to a decrease in production from Norwegian hydro power plants (with reservoirs), and the power export from Norway was twice as low compared to the week before. An interesting note is that Norway has had a net import of about 1 TWh so far (week 33) in 2019, while the Nordics as a whole have had a net export of 1 TWh.</p>
