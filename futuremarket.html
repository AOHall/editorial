										<h2>The Future Power Market</h2>

										<p>This article is based on a future analysis conducted by Statnett. </p>

									<p>The power system in the Nordics and in Europe is drastically changing, due to various factors such as cheaper wind and solar power, and politics of global warming. In their main scenario, Statnett predicts that the price will be maintained around 40 EUR/MWh until 2030 when the prices will drop. The development will contribute to greater oscillations in the power prices and more frequent periods with very high prices, but also many periods with very low prices.</p>
									<p>The last two years the power prices in Europe has risen from around 30 EUR/MWh to around 40 EUR/MWh, driven by higher prices on coal, gas and emissions trading (cap and trade).</p>
									<p>We have to expect more frequent and powerful peaks in the power price in the winter, due to a risen share of wind power that cannot be regulated amongst other things. Subsequently export, import or wind power often will decide the price in the market, and consequently the prices can increase sharply. When the surplus of effect in Norway is at a low, and the prices in neighbouring countries are high there will obviously be higher prices.</p>
									<p>This also works the other way around. There will be a lot more hours with very low prices throughout the year, however mainly in the summer when the consumption is at a low and the unregulated production is at a high.</p>
									<p>It can be hard to predict the future market for various reasons. The level of consumption is hard to predict. There are big possibilities for more industry in the Nordics, more electrification of the petroleum industry and not to mention many more and bigger data centers.</p>
									<p>There is reason to believe that the price of power will drop after 2030 by a few EUR/MWh considering the prices in Europe drops in line with development and implementation of solar and wind power.</p>
									<p>The share of power sources in 2018 in the European power pool is 38 % fossil energy, 29 % nuclear power, 17 % solar and wind power, and 16 % other renewable sources. They estimate the following share in 2030; 24 % fossil energy, 17 % nuclear power, 40 % solar and wind power, and 19 % other renewable sources.</p>
									<p>Stable marginal costs for thermal power plants is the reason why Statnett predicts that the prices in Europe maintains their present level until 2030. Towards 2040 they predict a decrease in the price following a continued growth within solar and wind power. They also predict that the prices for carbon dioxide will be higher than earlier, with a level around 35 EURO in 2040.</p>
									<p>The share of power produced renewably should increase from 35 % today to around 75 % in 2040. In the Nordics there will be more wind power and less nuclear power. The growth of solar and wind power is expected due to lower costs amongst other things. Political incentives are getting less prominent as the need for subsidiaries are decreasing due to a market-driven technological development.</p>
