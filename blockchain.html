										<h1>Blockchain in the Energy Sector</h1>
										<blockquote>Blockchain technology may become important in the energy sector. The energy sector generates a vast amount of transactions, and there are many participants in any energy interaction. Energy generators, distributors, traders, regulators and industrial end users are core players.</blockquote>

									<p>The energy ecosystem is complex and requires extensive trust and intermediaries. Blockchain technology seems well suited, at a basic level, to securely record and store transactions, thus increase integrity and trust. Additionally, an energy blockchain can provide secure storage of ownership records, particularly for energy certification.</p> 
									
									<h4>Different use cases</h4>
									<p>Some different cases for possible uses will now be presented. Verification of renewable electricity and of emission allowance. Another case is having a register that records and regulates ownership and current state of assets such as smart meters, generation facilities and networks. Another case is having smart meter data that could be shared with a variety of consumers without compromising privacy or security while at the same time offering the possibility to generate income from sharing.</p> 
									
									<p>Billing for Electric Vehicles (EV) is an example in the domain of energy billing. When more people buy EVs, an extensive network of thousands or even millions of charging stations will be required. Payment systems already exists for this, but an efficient billing mechanism can be provided by blockchain. For instance, slock.it enables secure, efficient blockchain transactions, without needing intermediaries, between devices. An example of a use of this is by opening a bicycle lock with a smartphone.</p>
									
									<p>Share&Charge allows anyone who owns an EV charger to become a provider. This is a good option as the EV charging network is developed, or perhaps it is the shape of how EV charging will be shaped in the future. Traditionally, major energy producers provide energy directly to customers through a distribution provider, but this model which has been the same for decades can potentially disrupt in the future.</p>

									<h4>A new marketplace</h4>
									
									<p>When industries and homeowners begin to produce their own power using for instance wind or solar, a marketplace where the consumer also becomes the producer can grow and become a norm. Facilitating a use of blockchain that uses smart contracts to manage energy trades can be utilized in the marketplace when selling excess power. Homeowner can accumulate cryptocurrency that could be converted to dollars or be used directly to purchase products. A technology to facilitate this is developing by several companies.</p> 
									
									<p>Grid Singularity supports many of these cases, using a theorem technology. Another cutting edge blockchain-based platform for trading energy is Power Ledger. In the UK, Electron is building a platform a platform for microgrid trading and for smart grid data management as well. SolarCoins are earned from homeowners who produce solar power.  The collection of SolarCoins is a result of authenticating the generation of power.</p>

									<p>The SolarCoin blockchain is a tradeable digital currency and can be used with retailers directly or converted into a local currency. Such a model gives incentives to the use of solar power. SolarCoin gets its value from being the product of power generation which produces the proof of work.</p>

									<p>It's evident that there is a lot of “energy” in the blockchain energy space. There's a lot of investment and research happening.</p>
