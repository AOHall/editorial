										<h1>The central european bidding zone issue</h1>
										<blockquote>The German-Austrian bidding zone was split in October 2018 leading to higher electricity prices in the Austrian power market. As a concequence Austrian industrials have launched an anti-competition proceeding against the German grid operator TenneT.</blockquote>

									<h3>The bidding zone split</h3>
									<p>ACER decided to split Europe's largest area of uniform electricity prices to avoid excessive and volatile exports from Germany's renewable production. A bidding zone is defined as an area in which market participants exchange energy without capacity allocation. The huge focus on renewables in Germany has lead to the rise of an oversupply from wind parks in the north, whose power flows do not go straight to the southern industrial zones. The main problem is the lack of power grids transporting electricity straight from north to south of Germany.</p>

									<p>Instead the electricity from the wind power is rerouted via Poland, the Czech Republic and Austria and back into Germany in what is called loop flows. This increases the grid's volatility and security risks. Austria, however, had benefited from these flows since with a common bidding zone they were able to buy surplus German power at low prices, store excess power in its pumped-storage plants and resell it at higher prices.</p>
									
									<p>However, Polish and Czech complaints about the network congestion led to a spilt of the power zone, as decided by Acer. Following this split, TenneT curbs the amount of power that is traded between Germany and Austria, exploiting their dominant market position. TenneT has been capping power flows at 4.9 GW as agreed between the German and Austrian network regulators to implement the decision made by Acer. The Austrian industrial complaint states that "the move leads to an anti-competitive market distortion, as the structural grid bottlenecks are not at the Austrian-German border but within Germany."</p>
									
									<h3>Why only one bidding zone?</h3>
									<p>Arguments Germany use for only having one bidding zone are the following: One single bidding zone guarantees that everyone across Germany enjoys the same conditions in terms of access to the grid, electricity generation and electricity consumption. This ensures equal access to the grid across Germany. Splitting Germany into several bidding zones would mean that there would no longer be a single wholesale electricity price rate. Therefore, abandoning the single bidding zone would be disadvantageous. There are obvious complications with the German power market as of now and it would be interesting to see how multiple bidding zones would handle these issues. In the future we will most likely see a change in the bidding zone system that Germany has.</p>
