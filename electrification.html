										<h1>Electrification</h1>
										<blockquote>With increasing political and societal focus on the climate, offshore platforms has to look for ways of producing oil and gas as climate friendly as possible. Electrification by clean onshore power or offshore wind power instead of offshore gas is one way of greenifying their production.</blockquote>
									</header>

									<p>Within 2020, 40 % of production on Norwegian platforms will be powered with electricity from the shore and not from on-board-gas according to Rystad Energy. The platforms Troll A, Gjøa, Valhall, Goliat, and lately also Johan Sverdrup are powered with shorepower. Over the last 15 years the share of platforms power with shorepower have gone from 10 % to 30 %. The Norwegian parliament forces the players to study electrification of new projects. In other words, the parliament creates a pressure on the players. At the same time CO2 costs are reaching higher levels, as both the Norwegian CO2-fee and EU’s quotas are increasing.</p>

									<p>The government has stated that the Norwegian CO2-fee is going to increase by 5 % each year. In addition, the price of ETS-quotas in Europa have quintupled. Companies must calculate remaining years of the platform, the distance between shore and platform, how the power is distributed on the platform as of now and how much it will cost to make the necessary changes. Some platforms will be more difficult and expensive to modify than others, there is also a big difference in partially substituting the gas power compared to full electrification of the platform with shorepower.</p>
									
									<p>New technology such as offshore wind power could also play an important role. Offshore wind farms can be located close to a platform creating a synergy between the platform and wind farm. There is also the possibility of a more holistic approach where power grid companies and infostructure investors collaborate in creating webs of power cables for certain areas in the sea. In this case the companies which owns the platforms reduce their costs. The Ministry of Petroleum and Energy will map the possibility of electrifying the largest onshore industrial plants in the country. Large oil and gas plants at Mongstad, Kårstø and Melkøya in Hammerfest are examples of installations that can reduce emissions by full or partial electrification. The large oil and gas plants account for a significant proportion of emissions, which Norway must cut significantly to reach EU's climate targets by 2030.</p>
