										<h1>Introduction to Nuclear Power</h1>
										<h2>Part 2</h2>
										<blockquote>Nuclear power is a source of energy that is widely debated in all corners of the world. The most common reason why people are negative to nuclear power is the danger of episodes like Chernobyl and Fukushima, and issues regarding waste disposal. Yet the potential of nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels is obvious.</blockquote>

									<h4>Fear of nuclear</h4>
									<p>Some people are afraid of the radiation from radioactive materials like uranium. The fact is that there is no real danger of radiation from a nuclear power plant as long as it is working properly. Some people believe that living in an area close to a nuclear power plant is dangerous. This is wrong. First of all radiation is a naturally occurring phenomenon. «Man-made» radiation is no different from natural radiation and it occurs all the time. Various medical equipments used at hospitals can also be radioactive, so if you are in and out of hospitals you are likely to get more radiation than from a nearby nuclear power plant. Also a plane ride will give you more radiation from outer space than a nuclear power plant. In fact the nuclear industry is responsible for less than 0.1% of the radiation that most people are exposed to in their daily lives. Medical exposure such as X-rays, diagnostic imaging and cancer treatment, account for 75% of the radiation to populations. So why are people afraid of nuclear power? There are mainly three reasons why nuclear energy has not escalated: The fear of radiation, the fear of nuclear weapons and the issue of radioactive waste</p> 
									
									<h4>Fear of radiation</h4>
									<p>The fear of radiation is an old way of thinking and there is actually no danger concerning it. Of course, people remember the accidents in Chernobyl and the earthquake in Fukushima. Stories about frogs with three heads and so on scares people. Radioactive material is dangerous when accidents like this happen, but these accidents are very rare. Accidents leading to deaths happen much more frequently in other energy sectors. Major studies all conclude that nuclear is an exceptionally safe way to produce electricity on an industrial scale. Nuclear has by far the lowest number of direct fatalities of any major energy source per kWh of energy produced – over 100 times less than hydro and liquefied natural gas. The accident in Chernobyl was a long time ago, and due to poor safety routines and engineering. The accident in Fukushima was due to an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, which is something we cannot protect ourselves against. A good option is of course to not build nuclear plants in areas where earthquakes and tsunamis are a problem.</p> 
									
									<p>Another reason people are afraid of nuclear is because of nuclear weapons. After the second world war and the nuclear bombs hitting Japan, people, and rightly so, got scared by the power of nuclear weapons. This combined with accidents like Chernobyl and Fukushima is a big reason why people are against nuclear power. But as of now, there are no countries that have made any sort of weapons after starting nuclear power plants for electricity production. And there are a lot of regulations monitoring nuclear facilities. If this is considered an issue, does it mean we should stop producing oil, because one can make fuel for airplanes that can carry bombs? </p>

									<h4>Managing radioactive waste</h4>
									<p>The third and final major reason why nuclear power is held back is the issue about managing the radioactive waste. The most significant high-level waste is the used nuclear fuel left after it is used in the process. Intermediate-level waste is steel components, filters etc. which can be contaminated. Also tools and work clothing can be lightly contaminated, and this is low-level waste. The high-level wastes represents a very small part of the waste generated (3%) but is highly radioactive (95%), while the low-level wastes represents the major part of the waste produced (90%) but contain very low radioactivity (1%). So how do we manage this waste? Used nuclear fuel is very hot and radioactive, and need cooling before it can be stored. Also people cannot get close to the material because of its radioactivity. Shielding in the form of concrete or steel is therefore needed, or alternatively water. It is therefore normal to use water as it is used both as cooling and shielding. Typically a reactor will remove its fuel underwater, and then it is transported to a storage pool. After about five years it can be moved to a dry ventilated concrete container. Today the used fuel is rarely recycled, but it is possible. The used fuel is about 96% uranium, 1% plutonium and 3% high-level waste. Over one-third of the energy produced in most nuclear power plants comes from plutonium, which is created in the reactor as a by-product. The uranium and plutonium can be re-used, while the remaining high-level waste is stored deep underground. Low-level waste is disposed in a landfill. So far underground disposal of high-level waste has not been used yet, but the first deep geological repositories for high-level nuclear waste is due to open in Finland in the 2020s. After all, the big issue concerning waste from nuclear power production is not a big issue after all. Other energy industries, for example oil or coal, also produce radioactive waste and other toxic or unpleasant wastes. The different is that the nuclear sector deals with its waste properly, and very carefully unlike other sectors.</p>

									<h4>Economy</h4>
									<p>From an economic point of view, nuclear power is cost competitive with other forms of electricity generation, except where there is direct access to low-cost fossil fuels. Due to complicated technology when extracting the uranium for rocks, it can be expensive. This is one big reason why a lot of, for example thorium in Norway, is not yet been extracted. It need to be invested a lot of money to get the uranium itself, in addition to the building and maintenance of the power plant itself which is more expansive compared to for example coal. But these challenges are not necessarily any bigger than for example when Norwegians started mining the sea bed for oil in the 60’s. It seemed very optimistic at the time to drill for oil in the middle of the sea, yet oil was found and now Norway is one of the world’s richest countries. A similar economic injection in the extraction of uranium or thorium and building off nuclear plants could start a new adventure and it would be carbon neutral!</p> 

									<h4>Nuclear compared to solar and wind</h4>
									<p>Although the recent focus on renewable energy like wind, solar and hydro power is a sign of a change in the power market, these energy sources can not replace the steady and reliable fossil sources. Also, many renewable energy sources make changes in the nature in the form of demanding a lot of space. A solar or wind farm takes a lot of space compared to a nuclear power plant. Powering a modern, and increasingly urban society with renewable energy alone would require many hundreds of times more space than doing so by either fossil fuels or nuclear. Also Solar and wind are intermittent sources of energy that require backup. According to «World nuclear association», the only potential complement for a system with high renewable penetration that is low carbon, continuous and scalable, is nuclear.</p>
									
									<p>So why is not nuclear power used to its fully potential? Fears of nuclear weapons and disasters like Chernobyl and Fukushima is some of the reasons why. Politicians have to invest in nuclear if this possibility is to be used to its fully potential. That can take time, since people are skeptical to nuclear power. Nevertheless, there is good reasons to believe that nuclear power will have a bigger share of the power market in the future, and «World nuclear association» concludes: There is no sustainable energy future without nuclear energy. To meet the growing demand for reliable, affordable and clean electricity, we will need all low-carbon energy sources to work together.</p>
